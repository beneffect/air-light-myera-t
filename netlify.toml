# If you have specific Node.js version requirements, ensure you have a .nvmrc file
# or set the NODE_VERSION environment variable in Netlify.
# For example, if you use Netlify environment variables:
# [build.environment]
#   NODE_VERSION = "18" # Or your desired Node.js version

# If you use Netlify Functions, you might have settings like this:
# [functions]
#   node_bundler = "esbuild"
#   [functions.environment]
#     NODE_VERSION = "18" # Or your desired Node.js version
